      <p>
        if you're a new cat parent or an experienced one with a<br /> new kitten, you might wonder if your
   cat knows their name.<br /> Thanks to the ever-growing field of feline science, we have an answer.<br />
    Yes, cats do know their<br /> name and they may respond with a meow, <br />a head butt, or by running towards you.

  Why they respond the way<br /> they do (and yes, sometimes they ignore you) is  <br />
   strongly rooted in their personality, biology, and upbringing.

     <div class=" esent"> <h2> ESSENTIAL TIPS IN RAISING A CAT</h2>
      <p>
        As pet parents, our<br /> ultimate goal is to provide a loving <br />and nurturing environment for our animal
       companions. From diet and exercise<br /> to mental stimulation and preventive care, <br/>there are many factors to consider
        to raise happy and healthy pets. <br />In this comprehensive care sheet,
       we’ll cover essential tips and tricks to help you on <br />your journey as a responsible pet owner

      <div  class="attack"><h2>WHY DOES MY CAT ATTACK ME</h2>
      <p>
        The short answer to “Why does my cat bite me?” is that they’re trying to tell you something.<br /> 
        The long answer is a bit more nuanced, but we can break it down <br />into three categories: they’re feeling annoyed<br />
         or threatened, they’re trying to<br /> get your attention, or they’re playing
      </p>
      <p>“The most common reason a cat bites you is that they aren’t <br />enjoying the current interaction.
         Biting is their way to say ‘back off’ when they feel threatened [or annoyed],” <br>
         says Rachel Barrack<br />, DVM, a veterinarian at Animal 
        Acupuncture in New York<br /> City. “Cats also may bite when playing, as they are natural predators.”
        <br />Deborah S. Greco, DVM, a veterinarian and the senior<br /> research scientist for Nestle <br/>
         Purina Petcare,<br /> adds that a cat might also bite if they want or<br /> need something from you. In that sense, 
        they may use biting as a means of trying to communicate that need. For example,<br/> 
        maybe their litter box needs cleaning, they’re craving some playtime, or they’re hungry. <br /><a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9oaOB3eeCAxUHCjQIHbh-DSsQFnoECBUQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Frehome.adoptapet.com%2Fanswers%2Fcat-rehoming%2Fwhy-do-cats-suddenly-attack-their-owners%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520many%2520possible%2520reasons%2Cfear%252C%2520or%2520a%2520medical%2520issue.&usg=AOvVaw3T7G851nntnRDMKKTDjmSJ&cshid=1701209996009532&opi=89978449">click here to get more information</a><br />
